# Txt2Sema4

Ever have to spell something out for someone over the phone?  Type any string into the text box on this program and click "pronounce" and this program will use the [NATO Phonetic Alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet) to give you a word to say for each letter you are trying to spell.  Saves the awkward searching for words whose first letters sound like the letter you are trying to say.

For example, the program converts "foo" into foxtrot oscar oscar and shows it on screen, optionally speaking it out loud to you if your phone has text to speech capability installed.


## Download/Install/Compatibility

The Android apk installer file is available under [downloads](https://github.com/jonathana/txt2sema4/downloads).  You can browser to it on your Android phone or scan the QR code to install it, if you have allowed your phone to install out-of-market apps.  I will probably put this in the store eventually.

The application should be compatible with Android versions 1.6 and higher.  It does not have any special requirements.  It is Samsung Galaxy Tab-compatible, and runs on my Nexus One.  You will not have access to the text to speech 

## Build Instructions

If you really want to build it yourself, the necessary artifacts to build it yourself with the Android Development Kit and Eclipse should be checked in.

Feel free to contact me via github with any questions or file bugs, whatever.

Have fun,

Jonathan
